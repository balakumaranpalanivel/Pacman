# Artificial Intelligence

This project is a work of exploring simple to advanced AI algorithms using Berkely's PacMan Framework

## Features

* Different search strategies such as depth-first, breadth-first, uniform-cost, A-Star search algorithms.
* Searching in Adversarial and Stochastic game words using MinMax, ExpectiMax search algorithms.
* Reinforcement Learning Algorithms - Both Model and Model-Free Algorithms
* Hidden Markov Models - forward and approximate inference schemes.
